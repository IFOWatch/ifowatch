<div class="content ">
  <p>The Yieldwatch IFO on PancakeSwap made history with recordbreaking participation. With the next IFO jsut around
the corner, IFOWatch wonders: when the limits of the IFO process are tested in such a manner,
do IFO tokens end up distributed fairly?</p>
<p><em>tl:dr; <a href="#tokens-sent-to-addresses-as-a-percent-of-the-total-number-of-tokens-sent">show me the graphs</a></em></p>
<p><em>tl:dr; [show me the code](TODO: github gist)</em></p>
<p><em>tl:dr; <a href="#is-there-a-better-way">show me how to fix it</a></em></p>
<hr>
<p>On 3/4/2021, PancakeSwap (PCS) hosted its 7th IFO, offering 8 million Yieldwatch tokens
(<a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x7a9f28eb62c791422aa23ceae1da9c847cbec9b0">$WATCH</a>) at $0.10 apiece,
for a total fundraising goal of <strong>$800,000</strong>. Over 10,000 eager investors pledged a sum
of money far greater, totaling <strong>over $560,000,000</strong> worth of CAKE-BNB tokens.</p>
<p>Once the dust had settled and the IFO was complete, lucky $WATCH holders sold each
$WATCH token to those who did not (or could not) participate for over $3 each&ndash;<strong>yielding a 30x gain</strong>.</p>
<p>Some might claim that those who speculated correctly were rewarded commensurately for their speculation. <strong>But the data may tell a different story.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The amount of dollars raised ($560M) clearly exceeds the sum of $WATCH tokens sold ($800K)&ndash;over
<strong>711x the funding goal.</strong> So when demand so grossly exceeds supply, how are the tokens actually allocated to buyers?</p>
<p>PancakeSwap uses an &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; method that assigns tokens to IFO participants
proportional to the amount that each participant pledges in comparison to the
total amount pledged. PCS explains the overflow method with each IFO offered on
the exchange: <a href="https://pancakeswap.medium.com/yieldwatch-watch-ifo-to-be-hosted-on-pancakeswap-d24301f17241">https://pancakeswap.medium.com/yieldwatch-watch-ifo-to-be-hosted-on-pancakeswap-d24301f17241</a></p>
<p>While <a href="">some</a> have <a href="">claimed</a> that the overflow method is &ldquo;<a href="">fair</a>,&rdquo; this post posits that the vast majority of
gains were realized by &ldquo;whales,&rdquo; or individuals who are
able to put up an amount of funds that is <strong>significantly disproportionate</strong> to total amount of funds raised. All the while,
the majority of participants were left comparatively very little tokens.
In effect this means that <strong>the rich got richer</strong> while everyone else got very little.</p>
<p>To verify this hypothesis, we can use the bscscan API to gather information
about the transactions that occurred during the $WATCH IFO. The code used to gather the data
used in this post is available (on github)[TODO:link].</p>
<hr>
<p>We can retrieve data from bscscan using the HTTP APIs published by Binance. In this post, we will use the
<a href="">python requests module</a> to do so.
First we need the bscscan API URL, which we can find from the <a href="https://bscscan.com/apis">bscscan documentation</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">code
</code></pre></div><p>In order to locate the data we are interested in, we need to determine the <em>contract</em> address (this is
the address of the token we want to get information about), and the <em>wallet</em> address where the IFO
tokens are distributed from. Using these two addresses, we can get a list of all transactions that
occurred involving both addresses:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">code
</code></pre></div><p>From this point we have all the data we need, and it is all about arranging it. (See the github gist for a
complete copy of the code that generates the graphs shown in this post using live bscscan data.)</p>
<hr>
<p>We will show two data sets:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of tokens sent to addresses <strong>as a percent of the total number of tokens sent</strong></li>
<li>The amount of tokens sent to addresses <strong>as a percent of the total number of participating adressess</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>By comparing these two data sets, we will show that the total amount of $WATCH assigned
disproportionally benefited the participants who <strong>already have more capital to pledge</strong> over first-time investors.</p>

<p><em>View interactive graphs <a href="/ifowatch/yieldwatch-graphs/">here</a></em></p>
<p>We can immediately make one very telling observation about this graph:
a total of <strong>ten addresses</strong> (or <strong>0.1%</strong> of 10,000+ participants) collected <strong>over 25%</strong> of $WATCH tokens.</p>
<p>Yet, if we visualize this data as a share of participating addresses, the story becomes even more frustrating.</p>

<p><em>View interactive graphs <a href="/ifowatch/yieldwatch-graphs/">here</a></em></p>
<p>This graph shows the same populations, as a share of total participants. Another piece of data becomes
immediately obvious when viewing this data: <strong>the majority</strong> (over 50%) of $WATCH tokens were collected by
a <strong>tiny fraction</strong> of total participants.</p>
<p>It is obvious that whales are dominating in the IFO process, and leaving little room for others to make gains.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="is-there-a-better-way">Is there a better way?</h1>
<p>The first question I came up with upon reckoning with this data is: would IFOs still be successful if whales were
prevented from monopolizing all of the gains?</p>
<p>We can also answer this question with data. If we sort the amount of $WATCH collected from smallest to largest,
we can find the exact number of participants that would have been required to meet the IFO funding goal:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>When executed, this code shows that the funding limit would have been reached with only the first <strong>1,406 participants</strong>
when arranged from smallest to largest contribution. In fact, the funding goal would have been reached without
a single contribution over <strong>$568.</strong> It is safe to say the IFO would have been successful <strong>without any whales at all.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly ~$500 may be too strict of an upper limit. But how would the situation have fared with a more reasonable
upper limit set? We can answer this with a simple simulation:</p>

<p>We leave the judgment of the merits of such limits as an ethical exercise for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-bots">But what about bots?</h3>
<p>If PancakeSwap were to impose a wallet cap with no additional measures, certainly whales might look towards &ldquo;botting&rdquo;
(or, using code to generate many wallets in order to circumvent any such limits). PancakeSwap has
<a href="TODO:link">even cited</a> such a possibility as a major deterrant from even
attempting to make the IFO process more equitable. However, anti-bot technology has existed for decades&ndash;for example,
even a simple <a href="">captcha test</a> would at least reduce the total
number of times a whale can physically attempt to solve the
captcha challenge within the IFO time period. It may not be a silver bullet, but instead an incremental improvement
(and one that in this writer&rsquo;s opinion is sorely needed).</p>
<p>IFO facilitators such as PancakeSwap could also look towards more high-tech forward-thinking on-chain solutions,
such as using ID-verifying technology like <a href="https://www.litentry.com/">Litentry</a> to ensure that individuals
don&rsquo;t participate part their fare share.</p>
